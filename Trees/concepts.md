# Types of Binary Trees

### Full Binary Tree
* All subtrees in the BT should have 0 or 2 children

### Perfect Binary Tree
* Binary tree having all leaf nodes at the same depth/height

### Complete Binary Tree
* All levels are completely filled, only the leaf level (last level) can be incompletely filled.
* Last level should have all nodes filled in the left (meaning no gaps in the tree horizontally)

### Balanced Binary Tree
* Maximum height of tree = log(n) [log is base 2], where n is the no of nodes

### Degenerate Binary Tree
* Every node has a single child in the tree


# Iterate over trees
1. Inorder Traversal (Left Root Right)

2. Postorder Traversal (Left Right Root)

3. Preorder Traversal (Root Left Right)

4. BFS Traversal (Breadth First Search):
Iterate level by level [Horizontal]

5. DFS Traversal (Depth First Search):
Go deep inside the subtree [Vertical]
